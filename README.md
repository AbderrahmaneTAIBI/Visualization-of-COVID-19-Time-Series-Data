# Report: Visualization of COVID-19 Time Series Data

## Introduction:
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted millions of people worldwide. To track and analyze the spread of the virus, data scientists have been collecting and analyzing data related to the pandemic. In this report, we present our visualization work on the COVID-19 time series data, which includes the number of confirmed cases for countries around the world.

## Data:
The data used in this report was obtained from the GitHub repository maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The data includes daily time series of confirmed cases for countries around the world.

## Visualization:
We used the Plotly Python library and Dash framework to create interactive visualizations of the COVID-19 time series data. The visualizations included a time-series line chart and a bubble chart of total cases.

The time-series line chart allows users to select one or more countries to display the confirmed cases over time. The chart also includes a dark mode option for better readability. Users can hover over the chart to see the exact number of confirmed cases on a specific date.

The bubble chart displays the total number of confirmed cases for each country. The size of the bubble represents the number of confirmed cases, and the color of the bubble represents the country. The chart also includes a dark mode option for better readability.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our visualization work on the COVID-19 time series data provides users with an interactive and informative way to track and analyze the spread of the virus. The visualizations allow users to explore the data by selecting specific countries and toggling between light and dark modes. Our work can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the general public to gain insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic.
